DRILL 1 — ArrayList + Filtering + Mapping

Build a list of students (name, mark).
Tasks:

Add 10 sample students

Filter names with mark > 80

Sort them in descending order

Print only names

This trains:
→ iteration
→ filtering
→ sorting
→ mapping

DRILL 2 — HashMap (Your real power)

Create HashMap<String, Integer> for product → price.

Tasks:

Add 10 products

Find product with max price

Remove a product

Update price of one product

Print only products cheaper than 500

This teaches:
→ key-value logic
→ map iteration
→ entryset usage

DRILL 3 — Real-World Mini Feature (Map + List)

Build a “Category Manager” for an e-commerce app

Structure:
HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>> categories

Example:

“Electronics” → [“Phone”, “Laptop”]

“Clothes” → [“Shirt”, “Jeans”]

Tasks:

Add 3 categories

Add items dynamically

Search: Give a product name → tell which category it belongs to

Remove a product properly

This is the drill that exposes actual skill.
If you can’t do this, you're not ready for backend or data roles.

🔧 OUTPUT

Make a Day2 folder in your repo and push all 3 drills.
