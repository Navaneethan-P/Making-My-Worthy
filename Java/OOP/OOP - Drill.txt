✅ OOP PRACTICE — DRILL 1 (ENCAPSULATION + CLASS DESIGN)

Build:
UserAccount class
Fields (all private):

username
email
balance

Methods:

deposit(amount)
withdraw(amount)
getBalance()
updateEmail(newEmail)

Rules:

Balance should NEVER go negative
Email must contain “@”
Use getters/setters properly

If you can’t structure this cleanly → your encapsulation is weak.

✅ OOP PRACTICE — DRILL 2 (ABSTRACTION + INTERFACE)

Create an interface:
PaymentMethod

pay(amount)
refund(amount)

Create classes:

CardPayment
UPIPayment

Each must implement logic differently.

If your brain gets stuck designing the methods → your abstraction is weak.

✅ OOP PRACTICE — DRILL 3 (INHERITANCE + POLYMORPHISM)

Base class:
Notification

message
send()

Child classes:

EmailNotification
SMSNotification
Both override send() differently.

Then create a list of notifications and call send() on each → polymorphism.
